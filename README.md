# TicTacToe vs AI
 This is a working Tic Tac Toe game where you can play against an AI, or locally against another human player. Of the two AI models, One makes random moves exclusively, and the other uses the Minmax algorithm to map out every possible gamestate of the tic tac toe board, making a tie a best case scenario.
